Trading basics
If you’re new to trading we recommend that you familiarise yourself with the basic concepts first. We have a wide range of articles and guides that cover important topics such as trading strategies and risk management which can be found here.

If you’re ready to start using our API, we highly recommend that you first understand how we treat our products in a development environment.

Market instruments
Market instruments are a fundamental aspect of our API. Each market instrument represents either a CFD or spread bet whose price is determined by an underlying asset or market. In the majority of cases you can take a long (buy) or short (sell) position on a market to take advantage of rising and falling prices. You can find more information on the markets you can trade at www.ig.com/uk/services-ig.

Our instruments are identified by proprietary EPICs, such as IX.D.FTSE.CFD.IP - this CFD contract shows that it is the FTSE100 cash price market.

There are several ways to locate instruments using our API:

Searching using the /markets?q={searchTerm} API
Browsing using the /market-navigation API, which mirrors the market finder navigation structure on our dealing platform
Using a watchlist that has either been created using the /watchlists API or our dealing platform
Please note that our markets are not always available to be traded. When retrieving market information on a particular product our API will also return the status of the market. Examples of market statuses are:

TRADEABLE - the market is open
CLOSED - we are not currently offering that market
A full list of market statuses along with descriptions can be found in the API reference.
Instrument prices
There are two ways to determine the latest bid (sell price)/offer (buy price) level for an instrument:

Subscribe to the instrument via the our streaming API. This is the recommended approach, allowing up to 40 concurrent subscriptions by default
Poll the /markets/{epic} API to obtain a regular market snapshot. This is not recommended as it will rapidly use up the API quota for an application
In addition, historical prices may be obtained via the /prices API.

Trading
Placing a trade involves opening a position. A basic position consists of:

An instrument and, if applicable, an expiry
An execution price level
A direction - buy or sell
Once opened, the position will then be either in profit or loss, depending on the market movement of the underlying instrument. Positions are then closed in order to realise any profit or loss.

Positions can either be opened immediately via the /positions API, or with conditional, working orders (via the /working-orders API) which only trigger when the desired price level is met. Positions will generally be created as market orders, where we will determine the appropriate execution price level when the position is placed. For more information about the different kinds of order types please visit the API order types section.

Confirming trades
Trade confirmation is done in two phases:

Acknowledgement- a deal reference is returned via the /positions/otc API when an order is placed
Confirmation - a deal identifier is received by subscribing to the TRADES:CONFIRMS Streaming API message (recommended), or by polling the /confirms REST API
Most orders are usually executed within a few milliseconds but it means the confirm may not be available immediately if there is a delay. Please also note the confirm is only available up to 1 minute via the REST API.
Trade history
Historical trade and account activity can be viewed via the /history/transactions and /history/activity APIs.

Instrument expiry
Some of our CFD and spread bet instruments have an associated expiry (or period). This is the date at which the instrument will automatically close, eg DEC-14. CFDs that do not expirehave an expiry of '-'.

When a market expires it will settle (close) based on the price of the underlying asset. You can instruct us to roll a product over which will result in your existing position being closed and automatically reopened with the next available expiry date, while realising any running profit or loss.

Market research
In addition to an EPIC, every instrument has an associated market group identifier, eg FT100. This typically refers to the underlying real-world instrument from which the IG instrument was derived. Market group identifiers are used by the research APIs such as /client-sentiment to provide contextual market information.

An instrument's market group may be determined via the /markets/{epic} API.

If you need more information please refer to the reference, glossary and support sections.

Tiered pricing
What is Tiered pricing and how does it work?

How does this affect how you use the API?
There are 2 new concepts that are exposed in our Public API

Tiered pricing
Repeat dealing windows
Tiered Pricing
Example price tier:
Tier	Bid price	Bid size	Ask price	Ask size
1	6500	400	6502	300
2	6499	800	6503	700
3	6498	1200	6504	1000
4	6497	1600	6505	1800
5	6496	2000	6506	2500
Example scenarios:
Sell/buy trades with sizes up to 400 should submit the price of 6500/6503 respectively
Sell/buy trades with size up to 800 should submit price of 6499/6504 respectively
Price tiers are exposed in a new Lightstreamer subscription.
Please see reference page for list of all fields: Streaming API Reference

If the instrument can be traded in multiple currencies, there will be a price tier per currency

See the following fields in the Streaming API Reference

CURRENCY1-5 - currency code
C1BIDSIZE1-5 The bid size thresholds for currency 1
C1ASKSIZE1-5 The ask size thresholds for currency 1
C2BIDSIZE1-5 The bid size thresholds for currency 2
C2ASKSIZE1-5 The ask size thresholds for currency 2
Recent trade history
Trading multiple times within a short time period in smaller sizes are still subject to price tiers. The sizes of previous trades are taken into account when deciding what price tier a trade belongs to and only recent trades are taken into account.

Using the example from the table above: If a user places 3 BUY trades of size 150 in quick succession, the first two trades are within the 300 size thresholds and the price submitted should be in the first tier (6502). However, the third trade will fall into the second tier, meaning users should submit the price from the second tier (6503).

How do I know what tier I am in when submitting multiple trades?
Repeat dealing windows are a way for users to keep track of sizes from previous trades that will be considered when trading.

A repeat dealing window is unique per instrument, direction, and currency.

Repeat dealing windows are exposed via streamed confirms under the TRADE:{account identifier} Lightstreamer subscription and also via the REST /repeat-dealing-window endpoint

Repeat dealing window example: User places a BUY trade with size 100 on instrument A at timestamp=0
This will result in a repeat deal window of:

direction=BUY, size=100, instrument=A, expiryTimestamp=30
The size of 100 will be taken into account when placing any trades before the expiry timestamp. e.g. Following on once again from the table above: BUY trades of size 200 are eligible for the first price tier (300), and larger sizes will be subject to higher price tiers.
User places another BUY trade with size 100 on instrument A at timestamp 15
This will result in another repeat deal window being added:

direction=BUY, size=100, instrument=A, expiryTimestamp=30
direction=BUY, size=100, instrument=A, expiryTimestamp=45
This means the size of 200 will be considered when placing a trade for instrument A in the BUY direction. At timestamp 31, the first repeat deal window will expire, and the only size 100 will be taken into consideration for subsequent trades.

API order types
There are two types of order available on our API:

Immediate orders
Resting orders
Immediate order types
There are two kinds of immediate order:

Market order
Limit fill or kill order
Note there is an additional order type "QUOTE" representing "IG-quoted" orders which is currently not supported.

Market order
A market order is an instruction to buy or sell at the best available price for the size of your order. When using this type of order you choose the size and direction of your order, but not the price.

You do not have any control over what price your order will be filled at; it will be filled at the then market price which may be worse than the indicative prices visible when placing the order.

This is because the full size of the order you request may not be available at the time you place your market order, and the price may change significantly between that time and when your order size becomes available. This is particularly true for markets that are not traded in high volumes, as well as orders submitted during fast-moving markets or outside the open hours of the underlying market.

Limit fill or kill
A limit fill or kill order is an instruction to buy or sell in a specified size within a specified price limit, which is either filled completely or rejected. Provided the market price is within the specified limit and there is sufficient volume available, the order will be filled at the prevailing market price.

The entire order will be rejected if:

The market price is outside your specified limit (higher for buy orders, lower for sell orders)
There is insufficient volume available to satisfy the full order size
Examples
Resting orders
There are two kinds of resting order:

Working orders (to open)
Attached or contingent orders (to close)
Both consist of limit and stop orders.

Working orders (to open)
Limit order - This is an order to open a position by buying when the market reaches a lower level than the current price, or selling short when the market hits a higher level than the current price. This is suitable if you think the market price will change direction when it hits a certain level
Stop order - This is an order to buy when the market hits a higher level than the current price, or sell when the market hits a lower level than the current price. This is suitable if you think the market will continue moving in the same direction once it hits a certain level
Attached or contingent orders (to close)
These orders can be attached to open positions or left as contingent orders attached to working orders to open.

Limit order - This is an order to close a long position when the market reaches a higher level than the current price, or close a short position when the market reaches a lower level. For example, let’s say you have a long position that’s currently in profit. If you have a target level at which you’d be happy to collect your gains, you can set a limit to close out your position when and if this level is met. You may then avoid the risk of a subsequent change in market direction wiping out your profit
Stop order - This is an order to close an open position by selling when the market reaches a lower level, or buying when the market reaches a higher level. This type of order is known as a stop-loss and is commonly used to close out a position at a predetermined level, effectively restricting the amount of money you could lose. Adding a stop order means your position will be closed if the market moves too far against you

REST trading API guide
Overview
REST (Representational State Transfer) is the standard way of accessing resources over the web. It is done through four standard HTTP operations:

GET
POST (create)
PUT (update)
DELETE
For example, when you enter http://www.ig.com into the browser address bar, the browser issues a GET HTTP request on the web page resource at that address, and returns a web page as a response. Similarly, in the case of our API, a GET HTTP request to https://api.ig.com/gateway/deal/positions would return a list of open positions on the active account.

The R in REST refers to the representation (or format) of the resource being accessed. In our case, it is the web-standard JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format.

If you have an IG demo account, we recommend that you run the sample application on the left, logging in using your demo account, and selecting 'Show HTTP' to see the API HTTP requests and responses in action.

HTTP requests
Section	Component
Action	HTTP operation	GET - retrieve a resource
PUT - replace a resource
POST - create a resource
DELETE - delete a resource
HTTPS	The secure web protocol. It ensures that requests are encrypted between the application and the API
demo-api.ig.com/gateway/deal	The API gateway location. Use api.ig.com instead of demo-api.ig.com for live account access
/positions	The address of the resource you are accessing, positions in this case
Request Header	X-IG-API-KEY: k	The API key k (obtained from My Account on our dealing platform) is how we identify and authorise the calling application
CST / Authorization	A valid access token identifying the client.
X-SECURITY-TOKEN / IG-ACCOUNT-ID	A valid account token or account id identifying the client's current account.
Content-Type: application/json	Request format type. This should always be set as indicated to json only
Accept: application/json; charset=UTF-8	Response format type. This should always be set as indicated to json only
Version: v	API version v (defaults to 1, if not specified)
Request Body	Only required for PUT or POST requests	JSON format
Authentication and authorisation
There are currently two mechanisms for logging into and accessing the API.

POST /session v1 and v2 return a CST header with a token identifying a client and an X-SECURITY-TOKEN header with a token identifying the current account. These headers should be passed on subsequent requests to the API. Both tokens are initially valid for 6 hours but get extended up to a maximum of 72 hours while they are in use.

POST /session v3 returns OAuth access and refresh tokens which the user can pass in subsequent API requests via the Authorization header, e.g.:

Authorization : Bearer 5d1ea445-568b-4748-ab47-af9b982bfb74

The access token only identifies the client so users should also pass an IG-ACCOUNT-ID header to specify the account the request applies to, e.g.:
IG-ACCOUNT-ID : PZVI2

The access token is only valid for a limited period of time (e.g. 60 seconds) specified by the login response.

       "oauthToken": {
               "access_token": "702f6580-25c7-4c04-931d-6000efa824f8",
               "refresh_token": "a9cec2d7-fd01-4d16-a2dd-7427ef6a471d",
               "scope": "profile",
               "token_type": "Bearer",
               "expires_in": "60"
       }
The refresh token can used to acquire a new access token, either before or after the access token has expired but please note that the refresh token does also expiry some time after the access token has expired (e.g. 10 minutes). A call to refresh an access token will also return a new refresh token.The scope for individual clients is always profile which allows full access to the user's account.
FIQL query filters
FIQL (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-atompub-fiql-00) defines a syntax for expressing filters on entries of a web feed so it can be used to query resources. The activity history is one of the endpoints supporting this syntax and provide a way to query activities, e.g.:


              "filter" : "status==ACCEPTED;(channel==PUBLIC_WEB_API,channel==PUBLIC_FIX_API);details.actions.actionType==WORKING_ORDER_DELETED" 
This query returns all activity history item representing a cancelled order either via the public Web or FIX API.
HTTP response
Section	Component
Response Header
X-REQUEST-ID	Identifies the request
HTTP status code
200	request executed fine
401	access denied
500	server failure
...	
Response Body	Request results, if any.	JSON format. In the event of an error, the body will be of the form:
{ "errorCode" : "the error code" }
Paging
Paging applies to a subset of endpoints returning a list of entries, such as e.g. historical data. A metadata section on the response should provide paging details:


    "metadata": {
        "paging": {
            "next": "/history/activity?version=3&from=2016-05-27T00:00:00&to=2016-05-27T09:04:49&detailed=true&pageSize=10"
        }
    }
In this case "next" will provide a link to retrieve the next page of data.

Errors
Error responses contain a 4xx or 5xx HTTP status and a body with the following format:


    { "errorCode": "the error code" }
User errors caused by e.g. malformed json or invalid requests will be returned as HTTP 4xx errors. The suffix of error codes in validation failures can change depending on the request field that caused the failure, e.g. "invalid.request.forceOpen" indicates that the value on request field "forceOpen" was invalid.

Streaming API Guide
Our streaming API enables you to stream real-time:

Market prices
Trade notifications
Account status notifications
To get started you will need to first download the Lightstreamer client library for your programming platform.

It is recommended that you read our REST API guide before using our streaming API in order to understand the process of obtaining secure connection tokens.

Concepts
Connect
To connect to an IG streaming server you’ll need to specify the following:

Element	Value
Lightstreamer Server	Lightstreamer server address returned by the /session API. This may be subject to change so should not be hard-coded
Identifier	Active account identifier
Password	CST-CST token|XST-X-SECURITY-TOKEN token, tokens obtained on login via the REST /session service
Callback Function	Optional function that will receive any Lightstreamer connection notifications
NOTE: The streaming API currently does not accept OAuth tokens so users holding OAuth bearer tokens should call GET /session?fetchSessionTokens=true to obtain CST and X-SECURITY-TOKEN tokens.

Subscribe
To subscribe for price or account updates, a subscription request must be made to Lightstreamer. A subscription request consists of:

A list of items (eg IG market identifiers)
A list of fields relevant to those items (eg BID, ASK)
Multiple subscriptions can be made, but each subscription may only contain items of one type. By default, up to 40 simultaneous subscriptions per connection may be created. Whilst it’s possible to increase this number by connecting more than once, this is a breach of IG’s terms and conditions and may result in your API permissions being revoked. Please contact us if you need to increase your usage quotas.

A Lightstreamer connection needs an active thread to stream data so it is important for applications to establish connections in separate threads. Creating multiple Lightstreamer connections on the main thread may cause connections to drop intermittently. The Lightstreamer client should also have the ability to reconnect in the event of a connection failure or if instructed by the Lightstreamer server (e.g. due to a LOOP rebind message). A re-connection attempt can fail if the CST and X-SECURITY-TOKEN tokens have expired in which case it will be necessary to re-authenticate to obtain new security tokens.

The full list of available subscription item identifiers and fields can be found here.

Example - Javascript Lightstreamer code
Connect

     function connectToLightstreamer(){

       // include the Lightstreamer LightstreamerClient module using require.js
       require(["LightstreamerClient"], function (LightstreamerClient) {

          // Instantiate Lightstreamer client instance
          lsClient = new LightstreamerClient(lsEndpoint);

          // Set up login credentials
          lsClient.connectionDetails.setUser(activeAccountId);
          lsClient.connectionDetails.setPassword("CST-" + client_token + "|XST-" + account_token);

          // Add connection event listener callback functions
          // Note: the Lightstreamer library will transparently attempt to reconnect a number of times
          // in the event of communicationss errors
          lsClient.addListener({
             onListenStart: function() {
                console.log('ListenStart');
             },
             onStatusChange: function(status) {
              console.log('Lightstreamer connection status:' + status);
             }
          });

          // Connect to Lightstreamer
          lsClient.connect();
       });
    }
  
Create a subscription
Each Lightstreamer subscription requires:

A Lightstreamer connection
A subscription type - only DISTINCT or MERGE are supported*
A list of items of the same type (ie price, account or epic). For example, a list of instrument EPICs in the case of a price subscription
The desired fields for those items
* DISTINCT indicates that each update should yield a notification and is required for trade notifications. MERGE indicates that updates occurring very close together should only yield one update, and is used for account and price notifications to regulate the update rate)

For example:


    function connectToLightstreamer(itemList, fieldList){
      // include the Lightstreamer Subscription module using require.js
        require(["Subscription"], function (Subscription) {

        var subscription = new Subscription(
            "MERGE",
            itemList, // e.g. {"MARKET:IX.D.FTSE.DAILY.IP","MARKET:MT.D.GC.MONTH1.IP"}
            fieldList // e.g. {"BID", "OFFER"}
        );

        // Set up Lightstreamer event listener
        subscription.addListener({
            onSubscription: function () {
                console.log('subscribed');
            },
            onUnsubscription: function () {
                console.log('unsubscribed');
            },
            onSubscriptionError: function (code, message) {
               console.log('subscription failure: ' + code + " message: " + message);
            },
            onItemUpdate: function (updateInfo) {
                // Lightstreamer published some data
                var epic = updateInfo.getItemName().split(":")[1];
